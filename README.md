# Optimization of Agriculture production


### This model predicts the best cropping patterns under given constraints.

Depending on the model applied for measuring the economic impact of climate
change and other perils, different techniques are employed. Python programming,
Visualization libraries are used for Data analysis when the best possible option
among a set of feasible options should be made. Agriculture is one of the major
revenue producing sectors of India and a source of survival. Numerous seasonal,
economic and biological patterns influence the crop production but unpredictable 
changes in these patterns lead toa great loss to farmers.
These risks can be reduced when suitable approaches are employed on data
related to soil type, temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity and crop type.
Whereas, crop forecasting can be predicted by deriving useful insights from these
agricultural data that aids farmers to decide on the crop they would like to plant
for the forthcoming year leading to maximum profit.
